Created as a CS50x final project, "steelDesign" is based on the Egyptian code of practice for steel construction and bridges (ECP 205) and M.U.S.T's (Misr university for science and technology) CE403 course, It aims to help students solve problem sets by providing step-by-step solutions to several structural steel design problems, At the moment the website supports tension and compression members design using equal angles only, But will support purlins and columns design in the near future. Intended for academic use only.

making steelDesign was possible thanks to [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
